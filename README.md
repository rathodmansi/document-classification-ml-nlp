## Document Classification using NLP, Machine Learning
### Objective
Perform document classification into four defined categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). Compare the classifier accuracy with different models ranging from Na√Øve Bayes to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and RCNN. By making use of different feature engineering techniques and extra Natural Language Processing (NLP) features create an accurate text classifier.


### Tech Stack
- Language- Python
- Libraries- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Keras, TensorFlow backend
- Models- Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Shallow Neural Network, Convulational Neural Network, RCNN

### Implementation
#### Open document_classifier.ipynb in Jupyter to go to the implementation details
